# Mobile-Architect---Programming
Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The app was designed to track user's weight in order to help the user monitor their personal health by recording weight loss.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The app has a login, registration, and weight entry screens. The design was made to be easy and simple for user's to navigate through it quickly.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
I broke the code down into smaller parts and used modular coding task to stay organized.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
I tested by using the emulator and checking the inputs, database storage, and navigation making sure everything ran correctly. 

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
A challenge I had was making sure the database worked with user accounts. I had to change and adjust the structure and queries to make it work.

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
With the database component I made sure the user login and weight entires were stored and retrieved correctly and it showed that I am able to connect backend login with the UI.
